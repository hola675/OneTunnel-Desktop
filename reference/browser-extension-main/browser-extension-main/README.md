# 1VPN Browser Extension

The 1VPN browser extension changes your IP address by routing your browser's internet traffic through one of our secure servers. 1VPN can be used to access region-restricted content, prevent ISPs and network administrators from knowing which websites you visit, bypass internet censorship, and protect against IP address-based tracking.
